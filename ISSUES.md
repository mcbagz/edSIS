# SIS Implementation Gap Analysis & Issues

This document outlines the discrepancies between the `SIS-Detailed-Specification.md` and the current state of the `sis-app` and `sis-backend`. It details missing features, incomplete implementations, and areas needing improvement to create a fully functional and user-friendly Student Information System.

---

## **Overall System & UI/UX Issues**

The general system structure is in place, but it lacks the polish and completeness required for a real-world SIS.

- **Inconsistent UI:** Many pages are placeholders (`<div>...Coming Soon</div>`) or have a very basic structure. A consistent and robust component library needs to be fully implemented and used across all views.
- **Lack of User Feedback:** There is minimal user feedback for actions. Toasts, loading indicators, and confirmation modals are used sporadically. This needs to be standardized.
- **No Responsive Design Implementation:** The specification requires a responsive design, but the current implementation does not appear to have been tested or developed for different screen sizes.
- **Incomplete Settings Module:** While a frontend component and backend controller now exist for Settings, the functionality is not fully integrated, and many settings are still missing.

## **1. Student Information Management**

This core module is partially implemented but is missing key features for a "Student 360" view.

### **Missing Backend Features & DB Changes:**

- **Enrollment History:** The `Enrollment` model exists but there are no APIs to query a student's full enrollment history across different schools or years.
- **Family Details:** The `StudentParent` model exists but is not fully utilized. There are no endpoints to manage these associations effectively (e.g., add/remove guardians, set contact preferences).

### **Missing Frontend Features:**

- **Student Profile Page (`StudentProfile.tsx`):**
    - **Demographics:** The page displays basic information but is missing fields like ethnicity, and there is no way to edit this information.

---

## **2. Admissions & Enrollment**

This module is in its very early stages.

### **Missing Backend Features & DB Changes:**

- **Application Tracking:** The `Application` and `ProspectiveStudent` models exist, but the APIs are minimal. There are no endpoints to update application status, add notes, or manage associated documents.
- **Enrollment Process:** There is an `EnrollmentWizard.tsx` page, but the backend logic to support a full enrollment process (e.g., assigning to homerooms, initial course selection) is missing.

### **Missing Frontend Features:**

- **Application Details Page:** The route `applications/:id` is a placeholder. A full view to see application details, review documents, and change status is needed.
- **Enrollment Wizard (`EnrollmentWizard.tsx`):** This page needs to be fully implemented to guide administrators through the process of enrolling an accepted applicant.

---

## **3. Scheduling**

The scheduling module has a decent foundation but is missing critical administrative features.

### **Missing Backend Features & DB Changes:**

- **Master Schedule Builder:** The `MasterSchedule.tsx` page allows creating/editing sections one by one. However, a true "Master Schedule Builder" would provide a more visual, grid-based tool to see the entire schedule at a glance and identify conflicts. The current conflict checking is a manual process.
- **Automated Student Scheduling:** The specification calls for automated scheduling based on student requests and course availability. This complex logic is completely missing.
- **Teacher Schedules:** While a teacher's schedule can be inferred, there is no dedicated API endpoint to fetch a teacher's complete schedule for a given term.

### **Missing Frontend Features:**

- **Master Schedule View (`MasterSchedule.tsx`):** The current view is a table. A more interactive, visual grid representing periods and days would be more effective for building a master schedule.
- **Student Scheduling (`StudentScheduling.tsx`):** This page is likely intended for students or counselors to request courses, but it is not fully implemented.
- **Teacher Schedule View:** There is no dedicated page for teachers to view their own schedules.

---

## **4. Attendance**

The attendance module is present but lacks the reporting and notification features specified.

### **Missing Backend Features & DB Changes:**

- **Automated Notifications:** There is no mechanism to trigger alerts to parents for absences. This would require a notification system and integration with a communication service (e.g., email, SMS).

### **Missing Frontend Features:**

- **Bulk Attendance Entry:** The UI for taking attendance is likely one student at a time. A more efficient interface for teachers to take attendance for an entire class period is needed.

---

## **5. Grading & Gradebook**

The gradebook is one of the more developed modules, but still has significant gaps.

### **Missing Backend Features & DB Changes:**

- **Weighted Gradebook:** The backend has an endpoint to calculate a weighted grade, but the `Assignment` model's `category` and `weight` fields are not fully utilized in a comprehensive way. The system needs to allow teachers to define their own grading categories and weights for each course section.
- **GPA Calculation:** An endpoint for GPA calculation exists, but the system needs a configurable way to define GPA scales (e.g., 4.0 scale, 5.0 scale) at the school level.
- **Transcripts:** There is no backend support for generating official academic transcripts. This would require aggregating all of a student's grades, courses, and GPA across their entire academic history.

### **Missing Frontend Features:**

- **Assignment Management (`Gradebook.tsx`):** The teacher's view has a placeholder for "Assignments". A full interface for creating, editing, and managing assignments is needed.
- **Report Cards (`ReportCard.tsx`):** This component exists but needs to be enhanced to generate official, printable report cards.
- **Transcripts:** The student portal has a placeholder for "Transcript". This needs to be implemented.
- **Admin Gradebook View:** The admin view in the gradebook is a placeholder. It needs to provide school-wide grade reports, GPA rankings, and settings for grading policies.

---

## **6. Parent & Student Portals**

These portals exist but are very limited.

### **Missing Backend Features & DB Changes:**

- **Parent-Student Association:** The backend needs to be improved to properly associate parents with students and allow parents to have a single account to view all their children.

### **Missing Frontend Features:**

- **Parent Portal:** The parent portal is mentioned but not truly implemented. A parent logging in should see a list of their children and be able to navigate to each child's information.
- **Student Portal:** The student portal is functional but incomplete. Key features like viewing assignment details and school announcements are missing.

---

## **7. Staff Management**

This module is a placeholder.

### **Missing Backend Features & DB Changes:**

- The `Staff` model exists, but the APIs are minimal. There are no endpoints for managing staff roles and permissions in a granular way.

### **Missing Frontend Features:**

- While a `StaffManagement.tsx` component exists, a full interface for administrators to add, edit, and manage staff profiles and system access is required.
