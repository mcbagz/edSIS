# Fixed Issues and Implementation Summary

## âœ… Fixed TypeScript Compilation Errors

### Issue: `authorize` function type errors
- **Problem**: Routes were passing arrays `['ADMIN']` to `authorize` function which expected individual UserRole parameters
- **Solution**: Changed all `authorize(['ADMIN'])` calls to `authorize('ADMIN')` in:
  - `customFieldRoutes.ts`
  - `settingsRoutes.ts`

### Issue: Attendance codes type error
- **Problem**: TypeScript couldn't infer the type for empty array in settings controller
- **Solution**: Added type annotation `as any[]` to `attendanceCodes: []`
