### **System Specification: Comprehensive Student Information System (SIS)**

This document outlines the functional and interface requirements for a new web-based Student Information System (SIS). The goal is to create a robust, intuitive, and feature-rich platform that supports the administrative and academic needs of educational institutions.

#### **1. General System Characteristics**

The system will be a modern, web-based application accessible via standard web browsers. It will feature:

*   **Role-Based Access:** Different user types (Administrator, Teacher, Parent, Student) will have distinct dashboards, permissions, and access to modules and data.
*   **Intuitive Navigation:** A clear, consistent navigation structure (e.g., sidebar menu, top navigation bar) will allow users to easily move between modules.
*   **Data-Driven Interface:** The UI will be designed to efficiently display, capture, and manage large volumes of educational data.
*   **Responsive Design:** The interface should adapt gracefully to various screen sizes, from large desktop monitors to tablets.
*   **Security:** Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms will protect sensitive student data.
